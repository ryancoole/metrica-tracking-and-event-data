# Metrica Tracking and Event Data

Metrica data can be found **<a href="https://github.com/metrica-sports/sample-data">HERE</a>**

To begin with, we will look at working with Metrica Sport's player tracking and event data. Options for visualising the data, and using tracking data to add context to shot maps and passing maps.(pass start and end location, event sequences leading up to goal,plot tracking data for five players for the first 1500 frames, player position at KO, player positions for goal)

Using tracking data to add further context to football analytics. Covers making movies from the data, measuring player velocities, and creating physical summary reports for players.

Building your own pitch control model in python and using it to evaluate a player's passing options. Pitch control measures the probability that a team will retain possession of the ball if they pass it to another location on the field. It can be used to evaluate passing options for a player, and quantify the probability of success.


Measuring the quality of player decision-making and valuing their actions. This tutorial introduces the concept of expected possession value (EPV), describes how to use EPV to quantify the value of passes, and demonstrates how you can combine EPV with pitch control to identify the best passing options available to the player on the ball.
